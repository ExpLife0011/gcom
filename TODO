TODO List for GCOM 0.3 -> GCOM 0.4
----------------------------------

1.  Write more tutorials and/or programmers reference chapter
2.  Re-factor the GCOM sources so that it's easier to add new
    functionality.
3.  Rewrite genuuid to conform more closely with the IETF draft
    standard (which was never adopted, but it's the algorithm that
    Microsoft uses for their system, so why not?).  Also ponder the
    support of taking an MD5 hash of a name, as per CORBA specs.
4.  Make greater use of COM itself to provide:
    a.  OS-independent filesystem access
    b.  Make GCOM completely isolated from registry implementation
    c.  Provide plug-ins for component library location and activation
    d.  Provide support for remote objects
    e.  Provide support for multithreading.
5.  Write an IDL compiler to ease the construction of COM components.
    Research both OMG IDL (preferred) and MS IDL (iick!).
